🚀 LOCAL AI ARCHITECTURE: MCP vs. RAGArchitecting Intelligence from Raw Data UnitsProject Status: Production-Ready | Data Integrity: 99.90% | Architecture: RAG-Enabled📖 The Engineering MissionThis repository documents the end-to-end transformation of high-volume, unstructured industry data into a semantically-aware AI knowledge system. Processing a total of 13,952 data units extracted from UK industry reports, this project bridges the gap between raw information and actionable intelligence.🏗️ Pipeline Architecture at a GlanceThe system is built on a four-stage industrial pipeline:Validation: A rigorous "Gatekeeper" phase ensuring a 99.90% integrity rate across 139 JSON data chunks.Enrichment: A semantic taxonomy layer that categorizes data into Public Policy, Business Impact, and Future of Work sectors.Vectorization: Deployment of a local Sentence-Transformer model to map 13,938 validated units into a 384-dimensional neural space.Retrieval (RAG): A custom-built query engine that provides context-filtered, high-precision search results using Cosine Similarity.This project serves as a blueprint for local-first AI architectures, prioritizing data privacy, technical rigor, and semantic accuracy.📌 Project OverviewThis project demonstrates the end-to-end engineering required to transform raw data into a professional AI knowledge system. Whether working with a custom dataset or your own proprietary data, this repository provides the blueprint for two distinct integration paths:MCP (Model Context Protocol): Direct tool-based connection.RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Semantic vector-based memory.The objective is to guide the transition from raw, fragmented files to a production-ready AI context.<p align="center"> <h2>🛠 THE 5-STAGE ENGINEERING PIPELINE</h2> </p><details><summary><b>Click to expand the 5-Stage Curriculum details</b></summary>Stage 1: Data Validation & Schema Enforcement: Implementing scripts to ensure every unit adheres to a strict schema, removing duplicates and correcting encoding errors.Stage 2: Semantic Metadata Enrichment: Programmatically tagging chunks with relevant metadata (Zone A, B, or C).Stage 3: Vectorization & Neural Embeddings: Converting text into high-dimensional vectors for semantic search.Stage 4: Vector Database Implementation: Utilizing local storage for sub-second retrieval.Stage 5: Inference & Pipeline Integration: Connecting the local engine to the data for grounded AI answers.</details><p align="center"> <h2>🏷️ STAGE 2: SEMANTIC TAXONOMY</h2> </p>To transform raw data into a structured knowledge base, we categorize each unit into one of three thematic "Zones":ZoneCategoryLogic / KeywordsGoalZone APublic & PolicyGovernment, NHS, Ethics, SafetyRegulatory guardrails.Zone BBusiness ImpactInvestment, Market, Revenue, StartupsEconomic growth.Zone CFuture of WorkSkills, Automation, Jobs, TrainingLabor evolution.📊 Latest Audit StatisticsTotal Individual Data Units: 13,952Successfully Validated: 13,938Integrity Rate: 99.90%<p align="center"> <h2>🧠 STAGE 3: NEURAL VECTORIZATION</h2> </p>To enable semantic search, the enriched dataset was transformed into dense vector embeddings.
