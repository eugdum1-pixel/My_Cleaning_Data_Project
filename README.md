# 🚀 Local AI Architecture — MCP vs RAG
Architecting intelligence from raw data units for private, local-first semantic search

---

**Project Status:** Production-Ready  
**Data Integrity:** 99.90%  
**Architecture:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enabled

## Overview
This repository documents an end-to-end engineering pipeline that converts high-volume, unstructured industry data into a semantically aware knowledge system. The pipeline validates, enriches, vectorizes, and serves data via a local RAG-enabled query engine. The project is intended as a blueprint for private, reproducible, production-grade local AI.

Key metrics
- Total raw data units processed: **13,952**
- Successfully validated units: **13,938**
- Integrity rate: **99.90%**
- Vector embeddings stored: **13,938**

## Architecture at a glance
The system is organized as a five-stage pipeline:

1. Validation — Gatekeeper phase that enforces schema and data integrity.  
2. Semantic enrichment — Adds metadata and taxonomy labels to improve retrieval relevance.  
3. Vectorization — Converts text into neural embeddings for semantic search.  
4. Vector storage — Efficient local storage for sub-second retrieval.  
5. Inference & integration — Connects local LLM engines to generate grounded answers.

## Detailed pipeline stages

### Stage 1 — Data validation & schema enforcement
- Purpose: Ensure each data unit conforms to a strict JSON schema, remove duplicates, and fix encoding issues.  
- Result: 13,938 of 13,952 units validated (99.90% integrity).

### Stage 2 — Semantic taxonomy & enrichment
Data units are programmatically categorized into thematic Zones to improve retrieval precision.

| Zone   | Category        | Keywords / Signals                        | Goal                            |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Zone A | Public & Policy  | government, NHS, ethics, safety           | Surface regulatory guardrails   |
| Zone B | Business Impact  | investment, market, revenue, startups     | Surface economic signals        |
| Zone C | Future of Work   | skills, automation, jobs, training        | Surface labour & skills trends  |

Enrichment includes adding Zone labels and additional metadata used as filters during retrieval.

### Stage 3 — Neural vectorization
Text units are converted to dense vector embeddings for semantic matching.

Technical specifications:
- Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Sentence-Transformers)  
- Dimensionality: 384  
- Total vectors: 13,938  
- Format: compressed NumPy archive (`.npz`)

### Stage 4 — Vector database & retrieval (RAG)
- Retrieval method: Cosine similarity over the 384-dimensional embeddings.  
- Engine: Local vector index optimized for sub-second retrieval.  
- Use case: When queried for policy-related topics (e.g., "Government safety standards for AI"), RAG returns high-relevance documents from Zone A while avoiding code/noise artifacts.

### Stage 5 — Inference & pipeline integration
- Local LLM engines (e.g., Ollama or other local models) are connected to provide grounded answers using retrieved context.  
- The system supports both RAG (vector + retrieval) and MCP (Model Context Protocol — direct model-context) integration patterns.

## Example result
- Query: "Government safety standards for AI"  
  Result: RAG retrieved high-relevance policymaking evidence from Zone A with contextual snippets and citations (e.g., international guidance references).

## Reproducing the pipeline
Ensure your environment has the required Python dependencies (see the Dependencies section).

1) Data validation
```bash
python validate_chunks.py
```
Ensures the 13,952 units meet the target integrity threshold.

2) Semantic enrichment
```bash
python enrich_metadata.py
```
Applies the Zone A/B/C taxonomy and other metadata to validated JSON units.

3) Neural vectorization
```bash
python create_embeddings.py
```
Generates 384-dimensional embeddings and writes them to `semantic_vectors.npz`.

4) RAG querying / interactive demo
```bash
python query_engine.py
```
Launches an interactive terminal to ask questions and retrieve context-aware answers.

Repository assets
- Core scripts: `validate_chunks.py`, `enrich_metadata.py`, `create_embeddings.py`, `query_engine.py`  
- Data store: `semantic_vectors.npz` (neural memory archive)  
- Reports: `stage_1_validation_report.md`

---

## Dependencies & environment
- Python 3.8+ recommended  
- Example packages: `sentence-transformers`, `numpy`, `faiss` or `annoy`, `orjson` or `ujson`  
- Install example:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes & best practices
- Keep raw data and vectors private — this repo is designed for local-first deployments.  
- Store the vector index and `.npz` archive securely if using sensitive data.  
- Version your schema and validation scripts to maintain reproducibility.  
- Add a short CHANGELOG when making schema or pipeline changes.

## Quick preview tip
If the GitHub preview shows sections merging:
- Ensure there is an empty line between headings/paragraphs and the next block.  
- Use fenced code blocks (```bash) for commands.  
- If tables look misaligned, make sure the pipe characters are present and there is a blank line before the table.
